\chapter{Crystal Structure and Surface Chemistry}
\section{X-Ray Diffraction Fundamentals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{5/16:}Final exam next Wednesday in class.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 50 minutes.
        \item Questions like the midterm.
        \item We can bring our notes and textbook, but cannot search online.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can we bring notes on a computer, like mine, or do we have to print?
        \end{itemize}
        \item 1 computation problem.
        \item We will write answers on paper.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Review of last lecture.
    \item Tian goes through some examples of naming crystallographic planes from pictures of them intersecting a unit cell.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The first example is a $111$ plane.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If asked to identify a $111$ plane, it is enough to identify it as a $111$ plane; we do not have to identify it as a possible $222$ plane, too.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Consider a plane intersecting the \textbf{a}, \textbf{b}, and \textbf{c} axes at $a'=2a/5$, $b'=b/2$, and $c'=c/5$, respectively.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Then $h=\frac{5}{2}$, $k=2$, and $l=5$.
            \item An easier way to show this, however, is with $h=5$, $k=4$, and $l=10$. Aren't these planes spaced twice as close together, though?
        \end{itemize}
        \item Consider a plane intersecting the \textbf{a}, \textbf{b}, and \textbf{c} axes at $a'=a/2$, $b'=b/2$, and $c'=-c/4$, respectively.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A convenient point to use as the origin in this case is the upper-left corner.
            \item Thus, the plane is $(2,2,-4)$.
            \item The question of could we denote the plane by $(1,1,-2)$: These two sets of planes are parallel, but the spacing of $(1,1,-2)$ would skip every plane like $(2,2,-4)$. Thus, we need $(2,2,-4)$ for the spacing.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Rules.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If you see a fraction, convert to integers.
        \item But do not reduce a ratio.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The fundamentals of X-ray diffraction.

    \end{figure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item An X-ray diffraction pattern is a collection of spots of varying intensity.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The arrangement of the spots provides a great deal of information on the crystal structure, as we will soon see.
        \end{itemize}
        \item We define
        \begin{equation*}
            \Delta = \overline{\text{A}_1\text{C}}-\overline{\text{A}_2\text{B}}
        \end{equation*}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Imagine two parallel rays of light incident on points $\text{A}_1$ and $\text{A}_2$ in a crystal lattice.
            \item $\overline{\text{A}_1\text{C}}$ is the distance that the bottom beam travels after being scattered at $\text{A}_1$ and before the top beam is scattered at $\text{A}_2$.
            \item Symmetrically, $\overline{\text{A}_2\text{B}}$ is the distance that the top beam travels after the bottom beam is scattered at $\text{A}_2$ and before being scattered at $\text{A}_2$.
            \item Either way, $\Delta$ represents a kind of phase offset that occurs upon scattering. Say, for instance, that the two waves are in phase before scattering. Then from the perspective of the top wave, the bottom wave gets offset by $\Delta$ relative to it during the scattering process, and vice versa from the perspective of the bottom wave.
        \end{itemize}
        \item If the distance $\Delta$ is equal to an integral multiple of the wavelength of the X-ray radiation, the two diffracted beams will interfere constructively. Mathematically, since
        \begin{align*}
            \overline{\text{A}_1\text{C}} &= a'\cos\alpha&
            \overline{\text{A}_2\text{B}} &= a'\cos\alpha_0
        \end{align*}
        as we may readily read from Figure \ref{fig:vonLaueDerivation}, we require
        \begin{align*}
            n\lambda &= \Delta\\
            &= \overline{\text{A}_1\text{C}}-\overline{\text{A}_2\text{B}}\\
            &= a'(\cos\alpha-\cos\alpha_0)\\
            nh\lambda &= a(\cos\alpha-\cos\alpha_0)
        \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{First-order reflection}: A diffraction spot that corresponds to $n=1$ in the above equation.
    \item \textbf{Second-order reflection}: A diffraction spot that corresponds to $n=2$ in the above equation.
    \item \textbf{$\bm{n}^\textbf{th}$-order reflection}: A diffraction spot that corresponds to $n$ in the above equation.
    \item \textbf{von Laue equations}: The following three equations, which relate the quantities involved in a first-order reflection. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{align*}
        a(\cos\alpha-\cos\alpha_0) &= h\lambda&
        b(\cos\beta-\cos\beta_0) &= k\lambda&
        c(\cos\gamma-\cos\gamma_0) &= l\lambda
    \end{align*}
    where $\alpha_0,\beta_0,\gamma_0$ are the angles of incidence of the X-ray radiation with respect to the \textbf{a}, \textbf{b}, and \textbf{c} axes of the crystal, respectively, and $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are the corresponding diffraction angles.
    \item An example of how to use the von Laue equations.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consider the diffraction pattern obtained when an X-ray beam is directed at a crystal whose unit cell is primitive cubic.
        \item Orient the crystal such that the incident X-rays are perpendicular to the \textbf{a} axis of the crystal.
        \item Then the relevant von Laue equation reduces to $a\cos\alpha=h\lambda$.
        \item It follows that discrete angles will yield discrete spots?
    \end{itemize}
    \item A more general situation.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For an arbitrary $hkl$ plane, the direction of diffraction with respect to the \textbf{a} axis is the same as that for the $h00$ planes. But there is also diffraction with respect to the \textbf{b} and \textbf{c} axes.
        \item The diffraction spots from an $hkl$ plane (with fixed $h$) will lie along the surface of a cone that makes an angle $\alpha$ with respect to the \textbf{a} axis of the crystal.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The Bragg diffraction.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We have
        \begin{equation*}
            \lambda=2\left( \frac{d}{n} \right)\sin\theta
        \end{equation*}
        where $\theta$ is the angle of incidence (and reflection) of the X-rays with respect to the lattice plane, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation, and $n=1,2,\dots$ is the order of the reflection.
        \item $d$ in terms of the Miller indices for a cubic unit cell gives
        \begin{equation*}
            \sin^2\theta = \frac{n^2\lambda^2}{4a^2}(h^2+k^2+l^2)
        \end{equation*}
        \item Tian will not go through the details, but there will be a homework problem in which we will explore this.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Rotating the sample vs. rotating the incident beam in an X-ray diffraction experiment.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In most cases, we fix the incident beam orientation and rotate the sample on the sample stage.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Midterms back today or tmw.
    \item The grade distribution in the course.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A or A- is typically 65-70\%.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\section{The Scattering Factor and Intensity}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \marginnote{5/18:}Reviews the Bragg diffraction.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There is no such thing as a 222 or a 333 lattice plane; rather, there are 111 lattice planes with higher order diffractions.
        \item Tian says something about higher order reflections?
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scattering factor} (of an atom): The following quantity, where $\rho(r)$ is the spherically symmetric electron density (number of electrons per unit volume) of the atom and $k=4\pi\sin(\theta)/\lambda$. In turn, $\theta$ is the scattering angle and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the X-radiation. \emph{Denoted by} $\bm{f}$. \emph{Given by}
    \begin{equation*}
        f = 4\pi\int_0^\infty\rho(r)\frac{\sin kr}{kr}r^2\dd{r}
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The integral $4\pi\int_0^\infty\rho(r)r^2\dd{r}$ gives the total number of electrons in the atom.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The total scattering intensity is related to the periodic structure of the electron density in the crystal.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the crystal is oriented such that the von Laue equation governing scattering from atoms along the $a$ axis is satisfied, then
        \begin{align*}
            \Delta_{11} &= \Delta_{22}
                = \frac{a}{h}(\cos\alpha-\cos\alpha_0)
                = \lambda&
            \Delta_{12} &= x(\cos\alpha-\cos\alpha_0)
        \end{align*}
        \item Combining these two equations, we learn that
        \begin{equation*}
            \Delta_{12} = \frac{\lambda hx}{a}
        \end{equation*}
        \item The difference in path length corresponds to a phase difference between the diffracted beams from successive 1 and 2 atoms of
        \begin{equation*}
            \phi = 2\pi\frac{\Delta_{12}}{\lambda}
            = 2\pi\frac{\lambda hx/a}{\lambda}
            = \frac{2\pi hx}{a}
        \end{equation*}
        \item The amplitude of the light scattered from successive 1 and 2 atoms is then
        \begin{align*}
            A &= f_1\cos\omega t+f_2\cos(\omega t+\phi)\\
            &= f_1\e[i\omega t]+f_2\e[i(\omega t+\phi)]
        \end{align*}
        \item The detected intensity is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the amplitude.
        \begin{align*}
            I \propto |A|^2 &= [f_1\e[i\omega t]+f_2\e[i(\omega t+\phi)]][f_1\e[-i\omega t]+f_2\e[-i(\omega t+\phi)]]\\
            &= f_1^2+f_1f_2\e[i\phi]+f_1f_2\e[-i\phi]+f_2^2\\
            &= f_1^2+f_2^2+2f_1f_2\cos\phi
        \end{align*}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The first two terms reflect the constructive interference of the X-rays scattered from the set of parallel planes through the 1 atoms and 2 atoms, respectively.
            \item The third term takes into account the interference of the scattering from these two sets of parallel planes.
        \end{itemize}
        \item We can therefore ignore the $\e[i\omega t]$ term and define
        \begin{equation*}
            F(h) = f_1+f_2\e[i\phi]
            = f_1+f_2\e[2\pi ihx/a]
        \end{equation*}
        \item The intensity is then proportional to $|F(h)|^2$.
        \item Generalizing to three dimensions for a unit cell that contains atoms of type $j$ located at points $x_j,y_j,z_j$ gives
        \begin{equation*}
            F(hkl) = \sum_jf_j\e[2\pi i(hx_j/a+ky_j/b+lz_j/c)]
            = \sum_jf_j\e[2\pi i(hx_j'+ky_j'+lz_j')]
        \end{equation*}
        where $x_j'=x_j/a$, $y_j'=y_j/b$, and $z_j'=z_j/c$.
    \end{itemize}
    \item An analysis of the \ce{CsCl} body-centered cubic lattice, where we take the unit cell to have eighth chloride atoms at every corner and one cesium ion in the center.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Taking $f_+$ to be the scattering factor of the \ce{Cs+} cations and $f_-$ to be the scattering factor of the \ce{Cl-} anions, we get
        \begin{align*}
            F(hkl) &= 1\times f_-\e[\pi i(h+k+l)]+\frac{1}{8}\times f_+\left[ \e[0]+\e[2\pi ih]+\e[2\pi ik]+\e[2\pi il]+\e[2\pi i(h+k)]+\e[2\pi i(k+l)]+\e[2\pi i(h+l)]+\e[2\pi i(h+k+l)] \right]\\
            &= f_-(-1)^{h+k+l}+\frac{1}{8}f_+[8]\\
            &=
            \begin{cases}
                f_++f_- & h+k+l\text{ is even}\\
                f_+-f_- & h+k+l\text{ is odd}
            \end{cases}
        \end{align*}
        where we substitute $\e[\pi i]=-1$ and $\e[2\pi i]=1$ to get from the first line to the second.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
